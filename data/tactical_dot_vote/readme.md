## Contradictions

As a result, this source contradicts the recommendations from
"tactical-vote.uk" and "essex against the tories":

```
Our external sources contracict! brentwood-and-ongar
Our external sources contracict! chelmsford
Our external sources contracict! colchester
Our external sources contracict! epping-forest
Our external sources contracict! maldon
Our external sources contracict! saffron-walden
Our external sources contracict! witham
```

The methodology is: who came 1st and 2nd in 2017. This seems a little
simplisitic: it ignores polling.

On the other hand, small changes in the polling numbers changed our own
recomendations for witham, so there may be something in this approach.
