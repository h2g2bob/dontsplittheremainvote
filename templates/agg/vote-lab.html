  <li>Vote for <em class="lab">Labour</em>. Labour are offering <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45640548">a new referendum with an option to remain</a>.</li>
  <li>No other remain party can win here. Splitting the vote could cause us to lose to a party supporting a no deal brexit.</li>
